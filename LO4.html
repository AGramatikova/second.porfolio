            <p class="stuff">
            I did a <strong>user test</strong> on my portfolio with my teacher Jo-An and two other people from my oil. <br>
            Jo-An gave me some helpful feedback. She liked my portfolio idea but suggested I make my name and message stand out more instead of the flower design, which made it feel like a flower shop. <br>
            So, I decided to simplify the design and blur some elements to keep the focus on my name and message.<br><br>
            The first person that i <strong>user tested</strong> with, told me that the nav bar was missing something and it could really use a design or some type of interaction. <br>
            He couldn’t give me a specific idea in mind, but I came up with a vision that when the nav bar is hovered over it glows. <br>
            I tried with multiple colors and thickness but I ended up sticking with a simple white thin glow.<br><br>
            The second person told me that an “about the portfolio” would be very useful. 
            I added it after the “about me” section, I explained what all the element in my website mean to me. I saw it as an introduction to my portfolio.

            For the <strong>development project</strong>, Jo-An said the order of the pages didn’t make sense. <br>
            The order that we put them in, wouldnt help the user understand the functiuonallity of the website.<br>
            For example, the countdown should come after the introduction, not before.
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            She also stated that we should promote it better so the user wants to buy the ticket.<br>
            Me and Mya adjusted the order to make the flow more logical. 
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            One of the ideas i thought of for example, a button 'buy tickets' that gets bigger and red every two seconds, so it grabs the attention, and the user caves in to click it.

            Making a project plan is from one hand easy but from another it could get confusing.<br>
            I find it hard to put my thoughts into words that others should understand when reading.<br>
            I do a very deep research about the subject like - what is needed, what isnt so needed and what i could add but is not a must.

            I was assigned to write the target audience section for the band, so I did some research before starting. <br>
            I included what the band told us about wanting to attract a younger audience(18-25yo) to listen to their music.
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            In the document, I also wrote about where we could help them find this target group. <br>
            For example, using social media platforms like <strong>Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube</strong>, which are popular with younger people. 
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            I also suggested promoting the band through <strong>events or collaborations</strong> that younger audiences would be interested in, like music festivals or working with influencers in the post-punk and new wave scenes. <br>
            By combining my research with the band's input and asking for advice from <strong>AI</strong>, I tried to create a plan that would help them reach the audience they want.

                The MoSCoW table was really helpful for prioritizing tasks. It made it clear what features i absolutely needed and which ones i could skip or save for later. It kept me on track and helped me make better decisions about where to spend time.<br>

            <p class="stuff">
                About all of the <strong>Must Have’s</strong> I thought of straight away it’s the basics – <strong>search, footer, contact us, about us and FAQ’s</strong>.<br>
                I visited a couple of travel agency websites to see what I should add, if im not skipping anything important or just something interesting and fun.<br> 
                I noticed that some had the option to change the language in the website, which I forgot of in the beginning but it is very important because afterall the website is about travelling and for people all over the world.<br>
                I don’t want to add a robot helper because all of the ones I have personally came across don’t help at all, and also I think hearing from a person their personal opinion is way more helpful.

                In one of our classes with Anke, we were tasked with creating an Excel table, splitting it into two sections, and writing each group member’s name. In the first section, we had to list what we believed our own core values were. <br>
                In the second section, the other group members wrote about us, so like that we could reflect on ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
                Another time, we had to create an Excel table again, but this time we wrote down our strengths and weaknesses. <br>
                I listed presenting and distraction as my weaknesses because I don’t enjoy speaking in front of people. <br>
                However, if I compare myself to the beginning of the semester, I’ve definitely overcome a significant portion of that anxiety. <br> 
                For strengths, I listed "creativity," because I’m always coming up with new ideas, enjoy designing, and have loved creating designs ever since I was little. 
                I also wrote "gets things done on time," because I’m very deadline-oriented and make sure to plan everything I need to do in advance. 
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
                Additionally, I’m not afraid to speak up and remind my teammates to stay on track when necessary.

            In every project i have been in, i always take the initiation to do the presentations, because i trully enjoy making them.<br> 
            I make sure to not miss any information that should be added, i do a good, deep research  and
            i make the designs simple but still having character by adding related elements. 
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
                The two presentation i did (showed above) were for the first group project i had about Health Innovation. 
                I searched on the internet Health inspired presentation designs, but didnt fancy any. That is why i went into Canva and started adding individual element connected to health.
                Got information from what the teachers provided us, made it shorter so there is not too much text on the screen.

            Making a Trello board in group projects is extremly useful, because like that everyone has a clear vision what to do and intill when to do it.<br>  
            Making one even in an individual project is also helpful, because like that i can keep track of everything i have to do, just like a reminder.<br>
            Adding deadlines motivates and makes sure you dont miss something.
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            In the showed above board i assigned all of the tasks individually to myself and my teammember Miya, avoiding confusion and doing the same thing.
            Sometimes the assigned tasks have to be changed either to another person or to a further or earlier deadline. <br>
            But that is why it is so useful to use trello, because like that the other group members get notified of the changes.

            The very first project i had with my group was for how we think 2050 would look like.
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            Each one of us was brainstorming, i came up with an idea for a drone that could help the workers find damages on the streets easier and sooner, but then we all agreed that the idea is good but will happen way before 2050, so we should think bigger.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            After that i came up with a robot that is half robot half human, flys around and whenever he sees any trouble on the streets, such as injuries, street brakage, etc. he would go inspect and help.<br>
            We asked the teachers what they thought and Lody told us to go even crazier, and that is exactly what we did. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            Kurosh came up with the idea that the robot has body parts that he stores in his stomach, so if there is a big accident that needs urgent care, he would have the supplies to help.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="stuff">
            Even when we were done with the project and the presentation time came, i wasn't happy how little we had, so i decided to do a physical prototype of our robot. Asked miya for help and got materials from the oil.<br>
