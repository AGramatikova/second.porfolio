        <p class="paragraph">I wouldn't describe myself as the leader in group projects, but rather as an innovator. My core values are creativity, positivity, acceptance, teamwork, and ensuring tasks are completed on time. While I always encourage collaboration, I’m not afraid to push my teammates when necessary to ensure deadlines are met. I also value feedback and frequently seek second opinions from those around me to ensure that my work aligns with both my vision and the perspectives of others.</p>

                <p>was assigned to write the target audience section for the band, so I did some research before starting. I included what the band told us about wanting to attract a younger audience to listen to their music. 
                    In the document, I also wrote about where we could help them find this target group. 
                    For example, using social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, which are popular with younger people. I also suggested promoting the band through events or collaborations that younger audiences would be interested in, like music festivals or working with influencers in the post-punk and new wave scenes. 
                    By combining my research with the band's input, I tried to create a plan that would help them reach the audience they want.
