        <p class="paragraph">I wouldn't describe myself as the leader in group projects, but rather as an innovator. <br>
        <strong>My core values</strong> are creativity, positivity, acceptance, teamwork, and ensuring tasks are completed on time. <br>
        While I always encourage collaboration, I’m not afraid to push my teammates when necessary to ensure deadlines are met. <br>
        I also value feedback and frequently seek second opinions from those around me to ensure that my work aligns with both my vision and the perspectives of others.</p>

                <p>
                I ask consistently for feedback from the people around me like friends, group members or in general people in my oil.
                It's very important for me to know if there is something missing in my work that i happened to forget or if i am not noticing something obvious.<br>
                I tend not to ask my teachers for help very often, which is something I’m trying to improve. 
                I want to seek their professional thoughts more frequently and also in that way i help them understand better where I stand in class.<br>
                If I compare the number of times I’ve gone to a teacher for feedback from the beginning of the semester until now, I can definitely say I’ve improved. 
                I might ask small, quick questions rather than requesting a full feedback session, but i personally find them more helpful</p>

                I was assigned to write the target audience section for the band, so I did some research before starting. I included what the band told us about wanting to attract a younger audience to listen to their music. 
                In the document, I also wrote about where we could help them find this target group. 
                For example, using social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, which are popular with younger people. I also suggested promoting the band through events or collaborations that younger audiences would be interested in, like music festivals or working with influencers in the post-punk and new wave scenes. 
                By combining my research with the band's input, I tried to create a plan that would help them reach the audience they want.

                    I attended the Open Day in Fontys, i was presenting the ICT & Media Design profile. I was nervous at first but i ended up enjoying it a lot. <br><br>
                    I met a lot of people that came to understand more about the classes and what we do, i told them all of the stuff i have done in the first semester and so far in the second one.<br>
                    I took a couple of them around the building, letting them know what and where they will do if they join the profile.<br>I as well took them to the Music and Video rooms on the 0 floor. <br>
                    My teacher from first semester Chris explained to me how the Video room works, what each camera works for and so on. I helped him chose i introduction video to show to the people coming in.<br><br>
                    Overall, I found it very entertaining and fun and would totally do it again.

                <p>
                    In one of our classes with Anke, we were tasked with creating an Excel table, splitting it into two sections, and writing each group member’s name. In the first section, we had to list what we believed our own core values were. 
                    In the second section, the other group members wrote about us, so like that we could reflect on ourselves. 
                    Another time, we had to create an Excel table again, but this time we wrote down our strengths and weaknesses. 
                    I listed presenting and distraction as my weaknesses because I don’t enjoy speaking in front of people. 
                    However, if I compare myself to the beginning of the semester, I’ve definitely overcome a significant portion of that anxiety. 
                    For strengths, I listed "creativity," because I’m always coming up with new ideas, enjoy designing, and have loved creating designs ever since I was little. 
                    I also wrote "gets things done on time," because I’m very deadline-oriented and make sure to plan everything I need to do in advance. 
                    Additionally, I’m not afraid to speak up and remind my teammates to stay on track when necessary.

    <p class="overall">
        I like designing more than developing, i really like to be creative by adding colors and my own designs, meanings behind element, giving ideas what where to add.
        Before Fontys i was in a Polygraphy And Photography school, i always liked the classes about designing and art. i always kept it on the simple side of the design but that doesnt mean i dont like or cannot go extreme.
        I have noticed that majority of the people like simple designs because it is easier to go around and understand. <br><br>
        I am happy how my portfolio has turned out, although i would try and change the background, so that it doesnt come off as too pink. i would make have some very light color elements fall in the background and just some outlines.
