                <p>
                For the first poster I made, I wanted to match the theme of the band Nasmak’s website.<br>
                I did some research about the band members so I could include pictures of them, and I also added an image I found online that fit the vibe.<br>
                I picked an electric-font because it represents the electric instruments they use, which I thought was important for their audience to notice.

                <p>
                For the second poster, I researched 'postpunk' and 'new wave,' which are the band’s genres.<br>
                I noticed that the style for these genres includes sharp and colorful elements, so I chose ones that I thought were appealing and eye-catching.<br>
                I also reused the electric font from the first poster to keep some consistency.

                This poster has a backstory: Nasmak PM had their very first practice in a chicken coop. To reflect that, I decided to include a chicken in the background<br>
                I went with a simple design but added a pop of red for contrast. To make it clear that the poster is for an upcoming event, I added an outline of a concert ticket to display the key information.

                The group came up with the idea for each one member to create some logos in their own taste and then all together to decide which one looks best. 
                I created these two with the ideas of a plus sign +. I connect it with health and positivity. 
                And as well it is very easily remembered for our target audience.

            <p>
            I wanted to be assigned to create the updated Instagram page of the band because I enjoy working with social media and just in general stuff connected with it. 
            The first thing I changed was their bio. I felt the existing one had too much information, so I simplified it by adding just the key details about the band. I kept the profile picture the same because I think it’s really eyecatching and would make people curious to check out their page.
            I also added highlights to make the page more organized and visually appealing. Each highlight had its own theme: the first one featured stories of the band performing or practicing, the second one was a QR code linking to their Instagram for easy sharing, and the last one was a Spotify highlight with their account and all of their released albums.
            For the photos, I carefully selected a few images of the band from the internet, making sure they either had the same color palette or gave off a similar vibe. 
            Finally, I added some custom posters created by me and my group to give the page a unique touch.
